# Pytorch extension for batch-wise eigencomputation for symmetric 3x3 matrices


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operator works on 32 and 64 bit floating point data types and is implemented both for CPU and GPU with custom kernels.
Implementations include forward and backward steps.

## Installation

Ensure that at least PyTorch >= 1.0.0 is installed, checkout repository and run:

```
python setup.py install
```

## Running tests

```
python setup.py test
```
Requires pytest and numpy.

## Usage

```python
import torch
from torch_sym3eig import Sym3Eig

matrices = torch.rand(100, 3, 3)
# Matrices need to be symmetric
matrices = (matrices + torch.transpose(matrices, 1, 2))/2.0

eig_vals, eig_vecs = Sym3Eig.apply(matrices)
```

## Benchmarks

Runtimes for 100k matrices on an i7-7700K @ 4.20GHz and a GTX Titan X, respectively:

|          | CPU      | GPU     |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Forward  | 23.59 ms | 1.93 ms |
| Backward | 20.47 ms | 1.31 ms |


Running benchmarks:
```
python test/benchmark.py 100000
```

### Parameters

* **x** *(Tensor)* - Input matrices (symmetric 3x3) `(number_of_matrices x 3 x 3)`.


### Returns

* **eig_vals** *(Tensor)* - Eigenvalues of the input matrices in no pre-defined order`(number_of_matrices x 3)`.
* **eig_vecs** *(Tensor)* - Corresponding eigenvectors in columns`(number_of_matrices x 3 x 3)`.

### Information
The module was initially created for and used in our [Deep Iterative Surface Normal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07172) paper, which can be cited as reference:
